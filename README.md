# watch-list-back-end

The back-end of a website i've been working on, which allows users to create an account and store a list of their favorite 
tv shows, which was the last episode they watched for each and can be notified when the next episodes will be available.
I am using Hibernate to store in a MySQL server and made a few REST API's.
